                <div class="body1">The location-based digital twin platform Orbro reflects various real-world data in real-time on a 3D map. I conducted 3D modeling for public transportation and infrastructure objects that move organically and reflect various data within Orbro.</div>

                <div class="body1">The Orbro environment, where the 3D objects are located, is a web-based 3D map based on Mapbox. Since web-based 3D maps have high accessibility for users but are difficult to implement high-performance graphics, it was important to minimize the vertex count in modeling.</div>

                <div class="body1">To reduce the vertex count of the models, I excluded as many complex elements as possible from the objects. At the same time, I designed each object to be distinguishable by emphasizing its distinctive features in minimal form. Additionally, I worked on optimizing the map loading speed by simplifying the shapes according to the camera zoom level.</div>

Especially in situations where the shapes are simplified according to the zoom level, UV mapping allowed more detailed elements to be included in the objects.</div>

                <h2>New challenges with new tools</h2>
                <div class="body1">As I was not originally a 3D designer, this project was a new challenge that required me to learn new modeling tools and techniques. Initially, there were many difficulties, but I completed the initial concept of Orbro by working on each object one by one. Personally, this project gave me the confidence to actively challenge myself in new fields in the future.</div>
