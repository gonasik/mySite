                <div class="body1">I led a project to define the design concepts and build the design patterns and system for orbro, a location-based digital twin platform. This design system is still being continuously refined and helps improve communication among designers, developers, and all team members involved in the product.</div>

                <div class="text_container3">
                    <h3>Handling Various Products and External Developers</h3>
                    <div class="body1">orbro has multiple product lines and allows external developers to create services using a plugin concept. Providing a consistent user experience without a standard guideline in such a diverse environment was very challenging.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="text_container3">
                    <h3>Work Efficiency</h3>
                    <div class="body1">orbro involves repetitive patterns such as data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization. Repeating these patterns manually each time required significant work hours, reducing project productivity.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="text_container3">
                    <h3>Communication Among Team Members</h3>
                    <div class="body1">As the team grew, different interpretations of terms and concepts emerged, lowering productivity. A guideline was needed to facilitate communication not only among designers and developers but also all members involved in the product.</div>

                <h2>Design Principles as System Standards</h2>
                <div class="body1">Before building the design system, we understood orbro's service environment and defined design principles that could address it. These principles served as the basis for decision-making during the design system construction and helped establish orbro's unique design philosophy.</div>

                <h2>Functional Definition of Components</h2>
                <div class="body1">We selected frequently reused design components from the current service and redefined their functions. We also analyzed and documented each component by its variants, anatomy, and states.</div>
            </div>

                <div class="body1">Previously, the same component was used for different functions, or different components were used in the same situation, compromising service consistency. To address this, we clearly defined the functional purpose, variants, usage notes, and UX guidelines for each component and documented them.</div>

                <div class="body1">With multiple designers working on the same components, there were inconsistencies in their appearance and design across different scenarios. This affected both service consistency and development efficiency. To solve this, we defined the interface elements and appearance of each component and documented the visual representation for different scenarios.</div>

                <h2>Typography Optimized for Data</h2>
                <div class="body1">orbro's old font system used 'Noto Sans CJK KR' for web and Android and 'Apple SD Gothic Neo' for iOS. This required double work and constant adjustment for layout changes caused by slight font differences, lowering team productivity. To resolve this, we decided to use a unified font.</div>

            <div class="body1">orbro's new font system adopted 'Spoqa Han Sans Neo,' which is free for commercial use and provides consistent usability across web and mobile (iOS/Android) environments. It also offers better readability for the numerous numbers used in our service. Typography was categorized into 'Title,' 'Body,' and 'Caption' based on their usage, and each category was documented by size and weight.</div>

                <div class="body1">We defined the main colors used in the system (Gray and Blue) and secondary colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Teal, Light Blue, Indigo, Purple) by brightness and organized them into a color palette. Frequently used colors were selected and documented as semantic color tokens along with their usage purposes.</div>

                    <div class="body1">Building the design system provided a great opportunity to understand the functions and roles of UI elements and the contexts in which they are used. This understanding helped resolve ambiguities in the design process and reduced unnecessary deliberation.</div>

                    <div class="body1">Collaborating with various teams on the project, I gained an organizational understanding of how design system elements are implemented and their impact on the service. Continuous communication allowed us to suggest better directions for the system.</div>

                <div class="text_container3">
                    <h3>Need for Continuous Improvement</h3>
                    <div class="body1">As the design system was developed early in the service development and alongside the service design, some parts were not suitable as the project progressed. To address this, we continuously identified and discussed system issues during the design process for ongoing improvement.</div>
