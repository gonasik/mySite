                <div class="body1">Everyone's Safety Bell is an auxiliary reporting service that can quickly respond to emergencies for vulnerable groups such as single-store operators or single residents in Gyeonggi-do. The service allows reporting through mobile (iOS/Android) and hardware devices, with received reports managed on a PC web screen. This project with Gyeonggi-do involved designing the entire system of the service and UX/UI design for each platform.</div>

                <h2>Emergency Reporting System for Rapid Response</h2>
                <div class="body1">The reporting system of Safety Bell is designed to respond immediately to emergencies in collaboration with the police. When the report button on the Safety Bell device is pressed, the report signal is transmitted through the registered phone, and the phone sends the emergency report to the police along with the pre-registered report information.</div>

                <div class="body1">The Safety Bell device is registered and reported through Bluetooth communication (BLE). Even if the primary communication is unstable, the mesh network allows finding nearby other Safety Bells, and the signal is transmitted through the discovered user's phone, ensuring normal reporting.</div>

                <div class="body1">The Everyone's Safety Bell mobile app allows users to register the device, check the current status during an actual report, or cancel incorrectly reported contents. It also provides functions to manage the device, such as checking registered device information, communication status, and firmware updates.</div>

                <div class="body1">This project with Gyeonggi-do was a new challenge with a different nature from typical projects. It involved limited planning/design based on functional requirements and responding to software certifications such as GS certification and web accessibility certification. Managing various stakeholders' different business aspects and coordinating numerous opinions at the center allowed me to learn the experience of responding to various issues.</div>
