                <h1>Everyone's Safety Bell — Emergency Reporting UX/UI Design</h1>
                <div class="body1">Everyone's Safety Bell is an auxiliary reporting service that can quickly respond to emergencies for vulnerable groups such as single-store operators or single residents in Gyeonggi-do. The service allows reporting through mobile (iOS/Android) and hardware devices, with received reports managed on a PC web screen. This project with Gyeonggi-do involved designing the entire system of the service and UX/UI design for each platform.</div>

                <div class="body1">The reporting system of Safety Bell is designed to respond to emergency situations immediately through cooperation with the police and Gyeonggi-do. When the report button on the Safety Bell device is pressed, the report signal is transmitted through the registered mobile phone, and the phone sends the pre-registered report information to the police and the Gyeonggi-do situation room instantly.</div>
