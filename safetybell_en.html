                <h1>Everyone's Safety Bell — Emergency Reporting UX/UI Design</h1>
                <div class="body1">Everyone's Safety Bell is an auxiliary reporting service that can quickly respond to emergencies for vulnerable groups such as single-store operators or single residents in Gyeonggi-do. The service allows reporting through mobile (iOS/Android) and hardware devices, with received reports managed on a PC web screen. This project with Gyeonggi-do involved designing the entire system of the service and UX/UI design for each platform.</div>

                <h2>Emergency Reporting System for Rapid Response</h2>
                <div class="body1">The Safety Bell reporting system is designed to respond immediately to emergencies in collaboration with the police. When the report button on the Safety Bell device is pressed, the signal is transmitted through the registered phone, which sends the emergency report to the police along with the pre-registered report information.</div>

                <div class="body1">The Safety Bell device communicates via Bluetooth (BLE). Even if the primary communication is unstable, the mesh network finds nearby Safety Bells, and the signal is transmitted through the discovered user's phone, ensuring the report is sent.</div>
