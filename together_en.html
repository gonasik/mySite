                <h1>together &nbsp;—&nbsp; Family Chore Sharing Service Design</h1>
                <div class="body1">together is a service that allows family members to share, manage, and communicate about household chores together. We observed various issues arising from chore sharing among family members and designed a service to solve these problems through various insights.</div>

                <h2>Unequal Chore Sharing Despite Perception</h2>
                <div class="body1">While the perception that household chores should be shared equally among family members is on the rise, the actual rate of equitable chore distribution remains very low. This has led to ongoing conflicts among family members, which have been exacerbated especially after COVID-19.</div>

                <h2>Lack of Ownership and Motivation</h2>
                <div class="body1">A common characteristic of families where chores are not well distributed is the tendency for one person to take on most of the work. In these cases, the spouse who is less involved in household chores tends to see helping as more of a favor rather than a shared responsibility, and there is also a lack of ongoing motivation.</div>

                <h2>Role Assignment and Fairness Lead to Better Chore Sharing</h2>
                <div class="body1">In couples where one person primarily handles the household chores, it was common for the person to frequently request help from other family members. On the other hand, couples who shared chores more equally were more likely to assign specific roles based on each person's abilities. This shows the importance of clear role assignment in chore sharing.</div>

                <h2>Understanding and Empathy are Key</h2>
                <div class="body1">Through analyzing the research results, we identified various challenges in household chores, the importance of attitude, and methods for efficiently performing chores. Among these various insights, the most important was understanding and empathizing with the thoughts, situations, and tendencies of others.</div>

                <h2>Two User Types in Situations of Concentrated Chore Burden</h2>
                <div class="body1">We identified two user types as personas in situations where the burden of household chores is concentrated on one person. Based on these personas, we created scenarios where user problems become apparent and applied these user needs to the service concept.</div>
